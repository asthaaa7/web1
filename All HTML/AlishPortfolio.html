      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Web Based Aplication</h3>
          <p>One of my proudest projects as an IT computing student was the development of a web-based <br>application for a local small business. The application aimed to automate their daily tasks and <br>improve efficiency. I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP to build a user-friendly interface<br> and linked it to a MySQL database to securely store and retrieve data. The end result was a <br>seamless system that streamlines the business's workflow and saves them time and resources.<br> This project allowed me to apply my technical skills and creativity to solve a real-world<br> problem, and I am confident that it will make a valuable addition to my portfolio.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Mobile App</h3>
          <p>Another exciting project I worked on as an IT computing student was the creation of a mobile app<br> for a local community event. The app provided real-time updates, interactive maps, and a social <br>network for attendees to connect and engage with one another. I utilized my knowledge of Java<br> and Android Studio to develop the app and integrated features such as push notifications,<br> geolocation, and camera integration. The app was well received by the community and received<br> positive feedback for its user-friendly design and robust functionality. This project gave me<br> the opportunity to showcase my mobile app development skills and I am proud to include it in my portfolio.</p>
