<h2>How technology has affected our daily life and business</h2>
<p class="paragraph">From a toddler to an old person we all are very familiar with technology. No matter where we go or what we do today, in one way or another, technology has its way on our life. Be it doing business or meetings or even minor things like scrolling through social medias or even watching movies technology is included. The need and demands of technology is increasing day by day. Nowadays, the very center of our daily life is technology. From the time our day starts to the end of our day technology has become our second air. </p>

<p>At the starting of our day, we check our devices as the device contains the mini version of our world itself. There is nothing that today’s technology has not accomplished to make our complicated life simpler and easier. Before we had to physically be available at any place to complete our tasks and missions. But at present we can do those things on our devices with the developing technology. For instance, previously we had to be in a bank to do money transaction but now we can do those works in our own place whenever we want.</p>

<p>Similarly, technology has made it easier to reach out to people who live in another corner of the world and stay in touch with them. It also have made it facile to get to know the lifestyle of other countries and their way of living. We can also know the news and changes that have been made in other places. Whenever we have to visit to new places we can always use technology to find our way so we do not get lost. Likewise, if we want to visit to new places and explore, we can always take suggestions from google and other social platforms. </p>

<p>Another way that technology has affected our daily life is the way we explore our interests. For example, if we have interest in tasting different foods from different places, technology has made it easier with the online services we get. In addition, we can also buy any goods online so we don’t have to search all over the place. This all falls under the way the business has been affected from technology and how these business has been expanding with needs and demands of people.</p>

<p>Business has been overly affected due to the current technology. People has been buying and selling goods online which has been quite useful for buyers as well as sellers. The buyers are able to buy from different varieties of websites with the budget they have. These are very advantageous to the customers as they opt to buy without having the trouble to step outside and search for the things they want as they can be available anywhere. Many trusted online e-commerce websites are available these days due to the technology. </p>

<p>The sellers are also benefited from the online business as they can have the transaction of goods online. They do not have to make any physical stores as people nowadays prefer to buy things only. They can also expand their business not only locally but globally as well. They can sell their goods with good customer services. It is also very easy to make their business known to every people due to the increase in use of technology at present, and they can give ad about their business in social platforms as well which will be very beneficial.</p>

<p>Technology do have its many more uses and advantages but as everything have its goods and bad there are many drawbacks of technology. People are being more and more dependent on technology and it has been affecting peoples life as a result. There are many people who use technology to commit crimes like cyber bullying, fraud in business, etc. So along with using the developing technologies we must be aware of these kinds of effects technology has. </p>
