        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>Network Security</h3>
            <p> I collaborated with a team of IT students to create a network security system for a simulated<br> small business. Our goal was to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of<br> the company's data. We implemented various security measures such as firewalls, intrusion<br> detection systems, and encryption algorithms. Additionally, we conducted penetration testing <br>to identify and address any potential security threats. This project allowed me to gain<br> practical experience in network security and exposed me to the importance of proactive<br> measures to protect against cyber attacks. It demonstrates my ability to work in a team <br>and apply my technical skills to real-world problems, making it a valuable addition to my portfolio.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Chatbox</h3>
            <p>Another project as an IT computing student, I developed a chatbot for a local tourist information center.<br> The chatbot was designed to assist visitors in finding information about nearby attractions,<br> restaurants, and accommodations. I used natural language processing techniques and built<br> the chatbot using Dialogflow and integrated it with a website. The chatbot was able to understand<br> and respond to a variety of questions, providing personalized recommendations and<br> information to visitors. This project allowed me to gain experience in developing conversational<br> interfaces and working with NLP technologies. I am excited to include this project in<br> my portfolio as it highlights my ability to create practical and user-friendly technology solutions.</p>
